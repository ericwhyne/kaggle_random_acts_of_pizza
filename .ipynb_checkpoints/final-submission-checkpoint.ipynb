    "## Random Acts of Pizza Kaggle Demo\n",

    "###James Route, Eric Whyne, Raymond Buhr, Filip Krunic\n",
    "This project is based on the [Random Acts of Pizza](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza) Kaggle competition. The competition is derived from Reddit's Random Acts of Pizza board, where users post a request and short message in hopes that someone else will read it and order them a pizza. The competition's objective is to accurately predict whether a post will successfully receive a pizza using a limited amount of data: the text of the post and title, and several metadata fields such as the post's timestamp and the number of posts the user has made.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given approximately 5500 sample posts in JSON format to work with. Of these, 4000 are reserved for training and the remaining 1500 are for testing. The test set has fewer data fields and does not include a field with the correct answers, so for much of this notebook we reserve about 500 samples in a dev set for checking accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we import all of the libraries we'll need. This notebook assumes that the files containing training and test data (train.json and test.json) are located in the same directory."
